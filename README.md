# AemetOpenData

It downloads daily and monthly climatological data from Aemet OpenData (https://www.aemet.es/es/datos_abiertos/AEMET_OpenData).

Requirements
* Python
* Pandas
* Jupyter or Jupyter lab (optional)

How to use it
* If you have installed Jupyter, use the notebook for instructional (recommended) or production purposes (Spanish texts).
* You can also use aemet_open_data from main.py. Firstly, you have to edit aemet_open_data_parameters.py because the parameters are written in this file. In this case, you don't need to have Jupyter 
  or Jupyter Lab installed.
