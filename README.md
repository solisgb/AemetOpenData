# AemetOpenData
It downloads some climatological data from Aemet OpenData (https://www.aemet.es/es/datos_abiertos/AEMET_OpenData)

Requirements
* pandas
* jupyter lab
* openpyxl (only if you want to save pandas dateframes as Excel files).

How to use it
* Open the notebook (Spanish texts)
* You can also run aemet_open_data from main.py. First, you have to edit it because the parameters are written in the file. In this case, you don't need to have Jupyter Lab installed.
